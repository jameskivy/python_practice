# Comparison Operators - are used to compare values

################################################################
# boolean express = True or False

# >   = greater than
# >=  = greater than or equal too
# <   = less than
# <=  = less than or equal too
# ==  = equals
# !=  = not equal

# "bag" > "apple" == True
# "bag" == "BAG" == False

# Conditional Statements = time to make a decision 
# you can have how many elif statements you want

# temperature = 32
# if temperature > 30:
#     print("It's warm")
#     print("Drink water")
# elif temperature > 20:
#     print("It's nice")
# else:
#     print("It's cold")

# print("Done")


# Ternary Operator 

# age = 14
# if age >= 18:
#     message = "Eligible"
# else:
#     message = "Not eligible"

# print(message)

# refactored - same as above just a cleaner way
age = 17
message = "Eligible" if age >= 18 else "Not eligible"
print(message)
